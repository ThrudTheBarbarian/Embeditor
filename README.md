# Embeditor
Simple embeddable C++ editor, based on [kilo](https://github.com/antirez/kilo)

I believe this is sufficiently different to not fall under the original license, but to cleave to the spirit of the thing, let's recall that kilo is written by Salvatore Sanfilippo and is copyright him, and Embeditor is released under the same 2-clause BSD license.
